# Homebrew-Cask

[Homebrew-Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) extends Homebrew and allows you to
install large binary files via a command-line tool. You can for example install
applications like Google Chrome, Dropbox, VLC and Spectacle. No more
downloading `.dmg` files and dragging them to your Applications folder!

## Installation

You need Homebrew on your system to use Cask, and you make Cask available by
adding it as a tap:

    $ brew tap caskroom/cask

## Search

To see if an app is available on Cask you can search on the [official Cask
website](https://caskroom.github.io/). You can also search in your terminal:

    $ brew search <package>
